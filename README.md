# vLuau

A drop-in replacement for `loadstring` in Roblox.

*yes I know this exists already, I didn't personally like the formatting/style so I made this*

Internally uses:
- **LuauCeption** by RadiatedExodus (GitHub: [RadiatedExodus/LuauCeption](https://github.com/RadiatedExodus/LuauCeption))
- **Fiu** by rce-incorporated (GitHub: [rce-incorporated/Fiu](https://github.com/rce-incorporated/Fiu))

## Warning
In testing, the compiler alone took about 30 MB of memory
*at runtime*. Be wary of memory usage.
